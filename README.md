# Node.js-basic-CRUD
Basic Node.js CRUD Application with Express, MongoDB, and Caesar Cipher Encryption

## ðŸ“Œ Description
This is a backend project I developed using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, designed to showcase my understanding of RESTful API development and data management. I created a full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) system that allows users to add, update, delete, and retrieve data from a MongoDB database.

To add an additional layer of complexity and learning, I implemented a custom Caesar Cipher encryption feature that encrypts sensitive data before it is saved to the database. When the data is accessed, it is automatically decrypted, demonstrating my ability to integrate custom logic into a real-world application.

This project helped me strengthen my skills in:
- Building server-side applications with Node.js and Express
- Structuring and securing API endpoints
- Managing database operations using Mongoose
- Writing and applying my own encryption logic to real data

I completed this project as part of an academic activity, and I am grateful to my professor for the opportunity and guidance throughout this assignment.
